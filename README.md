Network Simulator 2 (ns2) is a popular discrete event simulator for networking research. It provides substantial support for simulation of TCP, routing, and multicast protocols over wired and wireless (local and satellite) networks.

To implement and simulate the Link State Routing Algorithm in ns2, you need to follow these steps:

    Setup ns2 Environment:
        Ensure ns2 is installed on your system. You can download and install it from ns2 website.

    Create a TCL Script for Simulation:
        TCL (Tool Command Language) is used in ns2 to define the simulation parameters, nodes, and the topology.

    Define Link State Routing Protocol:
        ns2 has built-in support for several routing protocols like AODV, DSR, etc. For Link State Routing, you might need to implement OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) if it's not directly available. OSPF is a standard link-state routing protocol.
